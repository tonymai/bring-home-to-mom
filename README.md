[Bring Home To Mom](http://bringhometomom.herokuapp.com/) is a match-making and date-planning app targeted to parents. Parents create profiles for their children, browse and filter for potential matches, plan dates while communicating with the other child's parents, and split the cost of the upcoming date so everything is prepaid!  

Team Members: Jonathan Berk, Sofie Garden, Kevin Ceballos, Tony Mai

We utilized the Agile development methodology to deliver a complete, feature-full product under a tight 7-day period. We set up the structure/backbone of our app as a team, pair-programmed on challenging features, and worked solo to learn and implement new technologies. When working individually, we focused on discrete vertical slices (separate features) to ensure minimal Git workflow conflicts, and when conflicts arose, we resolved them systematically.

We solidified our knowledge on existing technologies while learning new APIs (Stripe, Twilio, Cloudinary, Rotten Tomatoes, and OMBD).

Technologies/frameworks used include:
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* handlebars.js
* Faye messaging system
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Responsive Grid System
* Stripe API
* Twilio API
* Cloudinary API
* Rotten Tomatoes API
* OMDB API

Product features include:
* Create child profiles
* Smart matching system based on filters and interests
* Autocomplete search
* Dates dashboard
* Design a date page
* Choose a date experience
* Real-time messaging system
